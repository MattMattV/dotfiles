Comment=Après avoir appuyé « Ctrl » + « Alt » + « H », la saisie de « Hello » sera simulée comme si vous l'aviez saisi. C'est particulièrement utile si vous êtes amené à saisir fréquemment un mot (par exemple « unsigned » ). Chaque appui de touche en entrée est séparée par deux-points « : ». Veuillez noter que les appuis de touches sont littéralement ce qu'ils sont, vous devez donc écrire exactement les touches que vous utiliseriez sur le clavier. Dans le tableau ci-dessous, la colonne de gauche montre l'entrée et celle de droite ce que vous devez saisir.\n\n « Entrée » (c'est-à-dire, un retour à la ligne)\t « Entrée » ou « Retour »\na (c'est-à-dire, « a » minuscule)\t A\nA (c'est-à-dire, « A » majuscule)\t « Maj » + « A »\n : (deux-points) \t« Maj » + « ;  »\n «   » (espace)\t « Espace »

Comment=Lit d'abord le commentaire de l'action « Saisir « Bonjour »  ».\n\n Qt Designer utilise « Ctrl » + « F4 » pour fermer les fenêtres. Cependant, dans KDE, le raccourci « Ctrl » + « F4 » fait passer sur le bureau virtuel 4, ce qui ne fonctionne donc pas dans Qt Designer. De plus, Qt Designer n'utilise pas le standard KDE « Ctrl » + « W » pour fermer la fenêtre.\n\n Ce problème peut être résolu en redirigeant « Ctrl » + « W » vers « Ctrl » + « F4 » lorsque Qt Designer est actif. A chaque fois que la séquence « Ctrl » + « W » sera utilisée alors, la séquence « Ctrl » + « F4 » sera envoyée à Qt Designer. Dans les autres applications, « Ctrl » + « W » continue à fonctionner de la manière habituelle.\n\n Maintenant, trois choses sont à définir : un nouveau raccourci clavier pour « Ctrl » + « W », une nouvelle action de saisie au clavier envoyant « Ctrl » + « F4 » et une nouvelle condition spécifiant que la fenêtre de QT Designer est active.\n Qt Designer semble toujours avoir « Qt Designer par Trolltech » pour titre de fenêtre, la condition vérifiera donc si la fenêtre active a bien de ce titre.

Comment=Lisez d'abord le commentaire de l'action « Saisir « Bonjour »  ».\n\n Tout comme l'action, celle-ci simule une saisie au clavier. Spécifiquement, lors de l'appui sur les touches « Ctrl » + « Alt » + « B », elle envoie « B » à XMMS (dans XMMS, la touche « B » sert à passer au morceau suivant). L'option « Envoyer à une fenêtre spécifique » est cochée et une fenêtre avec une classe contenant « XMMS_Player » est définie. Ainsi, la saisie sera toujours envoyée à cette fenêtre. De cette façon, vous pouvez toujours contrôler XMMS même si, par exemple, il est sur un bureau virtuel différent.\n\n (Veuillez exécuter « xprop » et cliquer sur la fenêtre de XMMS, puis cherchez « WM_CLASS » pour trouver « XMMS_Player »).

Comment=Dans KDE 3.1, Konqueror possède des onglets et maintenant vous pouvez aussi configurer des mouvements. \n\n Maintenez simplement enfoncé le bouton central de la souris et commencez à dessiner l'un des mouvements, et relâchez le bouton lorsque vous avez fini. Si vous avez seulement besoin de coller la sélection, cela fonctionne toujours, il suffit d'un simple clic avec le bouton central. (Vous pouvez changer le bouton de souris à utiliser dans la configuration générale).\n\n À partir de cet instant, les mouvements suivants sont disponibles : \n déplacement à droite puis à gauche - Suivant (« Alt » + « Flèche droite »)\n déplacement à gauche puis à droite - Précédent (« Alt » + « Flèche gauche »)\n déplacement en haut puis en bas - Dossier parent (« Alt » + « Flèche haut »)\n cercle dans le sens anti horaire - Recharger (« F5 »)\n\n Les formes des mouvements peuvent être simplement définies en les traçant dans la boîte de dialogue de configuration. Vous pouvez également vous aider de votre pavé numérique, les mouvements sont décrits sur une grille 3x3 où chaque case est numérotée de 1 à 9.\n\n Veuillez noter que vous devez effectuer exactement le même mouvement pour déclencher l'action. Pour cette raison, vous pouvez définir plusieurs mouvements pour une même action. Vous devriez essayer d'éviter les mouvements trop complexes où vous changez la direction de déplacement de la souris plus d'une fois. Par exemple, « 45654 x ou « 74123 » sont simples à exécuter, alors que « 1236987 » est déjà plus difficile.\n\n Les conditions pour tous les mouvements sont définis dans ce groupe. Tous ces mouvements ne sont actifs que si la fenêtre active est Konqueror (la classe contient « konqueror »).
